New Install Only Portion
I would highly suggest installing SQL Server Express, and separately SQL Server Management Studio to manage it.
Create database named "LPR."  
----------------------------------

Continue for New, start here for Update
Run file SQL Full Install or Update.sql in SQL Server Management Studio.

Compile, install, run LPR_Downloader app.
Fill out Configuration page.

Place LPR_Logo.jpg in c:\temp (or other, just update in configuration when you get there)
