I would highly suggest installing SQL Server Express, and separately SQL Server Management Studio to manage it.
Create database named "LPR."  If you choose to use an existing database or name it something different, modify the first line of each SQL File from "USE [LPR]" to the name of your database.
Run files in order (01-14) in SQL Server Management Studio.  The first batch will create the tables, the second batch will create the stored procedures.

Compile, install, run LPR_Downloader app.
Fill out Configuration page.

Place LPR_Logo.jpg in c:\temp (or other, just update in configuration when you get there)
